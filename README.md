# msc-lens
Google Lens is famous and powerful for image search. Users could use its fancy UI for image selection. I like its effect and wanna to apply it for services I owned. That's also the main reason I wrapped it into &lt;msc-lens />. Developers could received exactly the image which users just selected and do some analytics and recommend. Then render results through event which &lt;msc-lens /> provided.
